# Pomodoro Clock Timer App

This is a React-based Pomodoro Clock application. It is designed to help users work more efficiently using the Pomodoro technique. As a reference I took a website which called "Pomofocus" https://pomofocus.io/

## Getting Started

To get started with this application, simply clone this repository onto your local machine and run the following commands:

### `npm install --save react-tabs`

### `npm start`

This will install all the necessary dependencies and start the application on your local server.

## Usage

Once you have the application running, simply select the duration of your Pomodoro sessions, the length of your breaks, and the number of Pomodoros you would like to complete. The application will automatically start the timer and alert you when it is time to take a break or start a new Pomodoro.

## Technologies Used

This application was built using React, and also utilizes the following libraries:

* react-tabs
